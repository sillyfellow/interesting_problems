Mishmash -- aka -- Salad
========================

Here, I try to keep some of my random programs/algorithms/problems/solutions.
It might be in Python, C or any language I like. Over the past years, a lot of
programs have gotten accumulated in my ~/progs/<subfolders>,

Sometimes I copy a program from there to here and start revisioning it,
Sometimes I find a new little problem and code it directly here.

So, here are some:

1. Rotate a matrix
   Both recursive and non-recursive solutions; both clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations. In Python:
   https://github.com/sillyfellow/mishmash/blob/master/Python/rotate_matrix/rotate_square_matrix.py

2. Basic tree/pointer operations
   Only the basic operations, in C.

3. Find endianness, find fastest allocation in C, etc.
   Just some test code I've written over time.
   https://github.com/sillyfellow/mishmash/tree/master/C/find_endianness
   https://github.com/sillyfellow/mishmash/tree/master/C/compare_allocation

4. A lot of graph algorithms, shortest path, min-cut, etc.
   All of that in C++
   https://github.com/sillyfellow/mishmash/tree/master/C++/graph.cc

5. Trees in C++

More to come in future.
